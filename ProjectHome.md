**LJ Colligo** is a way to download all your [Live Journal](http://www.livejournal.com/) blog entries and comments to your local machine.

The formats are one single XML file (with all your entries and comments) and static HTML.

An option to generate a XML compatible with the [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org/) blog engine will be created.
