@@@mode: The protocol request mode@@@ getevents 
@@@user@@@ Username. Leading and trailing whitespace is ignored, as is case. 
@@@auth_method@@@ The authentication method used for this request. Default is 'clear', for plain-text authentication. 'cookie' or any of the challenge / response methods are also acceptable. 
@@@auth_challenge@@@ If using challenge / response authentication, this should be the challenge that was generated for your client. 
@@@auth_response@@@ If using challenge / response authentication, this should be the response hash you generate based on the challenge's formula. 
@@@prefersubject@@@ If this setting is set to true (1), then no subjects are returned, and the events are actually subjects if they exist, or if not, then they're the real events. This is useful when clients display history and need to give the user something to double-click. The subject is shorter and often more informative, so it'd be best to download only this. 
@@@noprops@@@ If this setting is set to true (1), then no meta-data properties are returned. 
@@@selecttype@@@ Determines how you want to specify what part of the journal to download. Valid values are day to download one entire day, lastn to get the most recent n entries (where n is specified in the howmany field), one to download just one specific entry, or syncitems to get some number of items (which the server decides) that have changed since a given time (specified in the lastsync parameter>). Not that because the server decides what items to send, you may or may not be getting everything that's changed. You should use the syncitems selecttype in conjuntions with the syncitems protocol mode. 
@@@lastsync: For a selecttype of syncitems, the date (in "yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm@@@ss" format) that you want to get updates since. 
@@@year@@@ For a selecttype of day, the 4-digit year of events you want to retrieve. 
@@@month@@@ For a selecttype of day, the 1- or 2-digit month of events you want to retrieve. 
@@@day@@@ For a selecttype of day, the 1- or 2-digit day of the month of events you want to retrieve. 
@@@howmany@@@ For a selecttype of lastn, how many entries to get. Defaults to 20. Maximum is 50. 
@@@itemid@@@ For a selecttype of one, the journal entry's unique ItemID for which you want to retrieve. Or, to retrieve the most recent entry, use the value -1. Using -1 has the added effect that the data is retrieved from the master database instead of a replicated slave. Clients with an "Edit last entry" feature might want to send -1, to make sure the data that comes back up is accurate, in case a slave database is a few seconds behind in replication. 
@@@lineendings@@@ The desired type of line-endings you'd like LiveJournal to return. Possible values are unix (0x0A (\n)), pc (0x0D0A (\r\n), the default), mac (0x0D (\r)), space (newlines become spaces), or dots (newlines become " ... "). The PC format was chosen as a default because it contains both Unix and Mac line endings in it, so if a client doesn't pick a line ending format, the worst case scenario is there are some ugly characters in the client's textbox beside the real newlines. 

@@@ver: (Optional) Protocol version supported by the client; assumed to be 0 if not specified. See Chapter 11@@@ Protocol Versions for details on the protocol version. 
@@@truncate@@@ (Optional) An optional value that if greater than or equal to 4, truncates the length of the returned events (after being decoded) to the value specified. Entries less than or equal to this length are left untouched. Values greater than this length are truncated to the specified length minus 3, and then have "..." appended to them, bringing the total length back up to what you specified. This is good for populating list boxes where only the beginning of the entry is important, and you'll double-click it to bring up the full entry. 
@@@beforedate: (Optional) For a selecttype of lastn, you can optionally include this variable and restrict all entries returned to be before the date you specify, which must be of the form yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm@@@ss. 
@@@usejournal@@@ (Optional) If getting the history of a shared journal, include this key and the username you wish to get the history of. By default, you load the history of "user" as specified above.
