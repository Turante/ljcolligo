event=From a <a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-jtp01274.html">article</a> on developer works.
<blockquote cite="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-jtp01274.html">
In HotSpot JVMs (Sun JDK 1.2 and later), things got a lot better -- the
Sun JDKs moved to a generational collector. Because a copying collector
is used for the young generation, the free space in the heap is always
contiguous so that allocation of a new object from the heap can be done
through a simple pointer addition, as shown in Listing 1. <strong>This makes object allocation in Java applications significantly cheaper than it is in C</strong>,
a possibility that many developers at first have difficulty imagining.
Similarly, because copying collectors do not visit dead objects, a heap
with a large number of temporary objects, which is a common situation
in Java applications, costs very little to collect; simply trace and
copy the live objects to a survivor space and reclaim the entire heap
in one fell swoop. No free lists, no block coalescing, no compacting --
just wipe the heap clean and start over. So both allocation and
deallocation costs per object went way down in JDK 1.2. </blockquote>

event=I'm activating again my desktop (I've being using my wife's machine since we've got married one year ago) in the last days, basically making some backups, from the kubuntu partition, from the winXP partition, data partitions, et cetera. To after all that install just Kubuntu and try again to live only with a linux distro at home :)<br/><br/>My motivation to do such a change was that my computer was presenting some strange behavior the last weeks I had used it, like deciding booting by itself, Kubuntu was reporting some Hard Disk errors on start up and bad things like that.<br/><br/>My problem began when I decided to reset my master boot record in order to have grub to be gonne. I've created my Partition Magic (old version 8.0) rescue disks and booted. To my surprise the <code>fdisk /mbr</code> did not work and complained about not being capable of save my current partition info in order to change to a new one. Well, I don't know why I decided to set my first partition to be bootable (it was already but I thought it couldn't make any damage...)<br/><br/>After that my first partition, the one with all my computer life since I was a teenager building little Clipper frankensteins, was gonne! The Kubuntu live CD was not booting anymore, and I was lost. <br/><br/>My first idea was to look at wikipedia's page about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fdisk">fdisk</a>, which led me to the wonderful free tool called <a href="http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk">TestDisk</a>. On its web site I found a link to another gift from the GNU/Linux community, the <a href="http://gparted.sourceforge.net/livecd.php">GParted Live CD</a>.<blockquote><a href="http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk">TestDisk</a> is a powerful free data recovery software! It was primarily designed to help <span style="font-weight: bold;">recover lost partitions and/or make non-booting disks bootable again</span> when these symptoms are caused by faulty software, certain types of viruses or human error (such as accidentally deleting your Partition Table). Partition table recovery using TestDisk is really easy.</blockquote>To resume, I've booted with the GParted  live cd, openned a shell and used the <code>testdisk</code> utility to recover my lost partitions and it worked like a sharp <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katana">Katana</a> slicing some puddin =)<br/><br/>A happy end to all my arcane files, thanks TestDisk, GParted Live CD project and Wikipedia!<br/><br/><div style="text-align: right;"><img alt="testdisk logo" src="http://www.cgsecurity.org/testdisk_doc/testdisklogo2.gif"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        <img alt="gnome logo" src="http://gparted.sourceforge.net/images/gnome-64.png"/></div>

event=It's quite common to meet software developers who actually think that the difference between 2 programming languages are only their syntax.<br /> <br /> My first contact with a opposite opinion, strongly firmed on good arguments and examples, was reading [<a href="http://www.mindview.net/Books/TIJ/">Thinking in Java</a>] in the third year of my graduation course. As the name says already, the book is about not only java syntax and vocabulary but with a paramount emphasis on the Usage of Java, the unofficial idioms used by its community founders.<br /> <br /> In my years of software development unfortunately I've came to know that most developers simply ignore this, and try to code in Java like they do in C++, or in Python like they do in Java, etc.<br /> <br /> Not only people ignore this but when you talk to then about the need of studying how to "Think" in some language they simply don't value your advice. Well, on time, they will know that, but till then much code will be oddly written and that's what motivates this post.<br /> <br /> To my surprise today, while waiting my <i>light-speed</i> machine to boot, I was reading the foreword of [<a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/effective/">Effective Java</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Bloch">Joshua Bloch</a>] written by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_L._Steele,_Jr.">Guy Steele</a>  (yeah, the LISP guy ;). In this foreword Steele wisely describes this very problem of most books focusing only on <b>Grammar and Vocabulary and *not* Usage</b> and shows a good parallel with the learning of spoken languages.<br /> <br /> It was very pleasant to see this flag raised not only by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Eckel">Bruce Eckel</a> (author of the best Java book Thinking in Java) but also by another great computer scientist like Guy Steele.<br />  <br /> Now if you don't agree with me, the reputation of both above authors might be a stronger influence you to give this idea some <i>thinking</i> ;)<br /> <br /> When learning a new language look for the source code of a well established project, the language syntax and APIs will also be there and with a good change alongside with the good practices.<br /> <br /> By the way, [Effective Java] it's just about <a href="http://java.sun.com">Java</a> good idioms.

event=As I <a href="http://bpfurtado.livejournal.com/40282.html">quoted</a> Yakov here before: If you would like to add Java pyrotechnic new features, consider letting Java doing its fantastic job where it is and give life to your ideas in a new language, and better yet, a language with a compiler to java bytecode, that's what Scala folks did! <blockquote> Scala is a statically typed, object-oriented programming language that blends imperative and functional programming styles. Scala is designed to integrate easily with applications that run on modern virtual machines, primarily the Java virtual machine (JVM). <span style="font-weight: bold;">The main Scala compiler, scalac, generates Java class files</span> that can be run on the JVM. </blockquote> <blockquote> Scala was developed starting in 2003 by Martin Odersky's group at EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland. Previously, Martin had been active in the Java field. He co-designed the first version of Java generics and was the original author of the current javac compiler. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The work on Scala was motivated by the desire to overcome limitations imposed by backwards compatibility with Java. So Scala is not a superset of Java, but it retains seamless interoperability</span>. </blockquote> <blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;"> One reason you might want to use Scala is that it allows you to increase your productivity compared to Java while leveraging JVM execution speed, your existing investments in Java code, knowledge, and the vast array of APIs available for the JVM.</span> <span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">It has the conciseness of a dynamic language like Ruby or Python</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">but it is statically typed, like Java</span>. Another reason is that Scala comes with an Erlang-like Actors library that greatly simplifies concurrent programming, but runs on the JVM. </blockquote> From <a href="http://www.artima.com/scalazine/articles/steps.html">First steps to Scala</a>.

This can be accomplished by adding extra bits of data to a host's DNS record. In this way, <span style="font-weight: bold;">iTunes, Safari, or any other Bonjour-friendly program, can discover and use services that reside on other Internet hosts</span>. </blockquote> <blockquote>In contrast to Jini's reliance on Java and code mobility, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Bonjour simply extends the existing DNS mechanisms</span>, and uses a service's protocol type, defined as a string, in service discovery. </blockquote><blockquote style="font-weight: bold;">The beauty of the Jini vision was all kinds of devices and software discovering and communicating with one another, making networked services seamlessly useable by anyone.</blockquote><div style="float: right; margin-right: 2em;"><img alt="Bonjour logo" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9f/Apple_Bonjour_Logo.png/128px-Apple_Bonjour_Logo.png" /><img src="http://www.jini.org/w/images/jini-clr-small.gif" alt="Jini logo" /></div>

I wanted to rewrite it anyway, to remove the dependency on the C stdio library. The new distinction between bytes and text strings required a (subtle) change in API, and the two projects were undertaken hand in hand. In the new library, <span style="font-weight: bold;">there is a clear distinction between binary streams (opened with a mode like "rb" or "wb") and text streams (opened with a mode not containing "b").</span> Text streams have a new attribute, the encoding, which can be set explicitly when the stream is opened; if no encoding is specified, a system-specific default is used (which might use guessing when an existing file is being opened).</blockquote>Above the binary streams versus the text streams are very similiar to java.io.Reader/Writer's and Input/Output Streams, which are several years old by now ;)<br /><blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">Read operations on binary streams return bytes arrays, while read operations on text streams return (Unicode) text strings;</span> and similar for write operations. Writing a text string to a binary stream or a bytes array to a text stream will raise an exception.</blockquote>

Is a bridge needed?)<br /><blockquote><br />First, of course, it's necessary to bring in the module that provides the bridge to the JVM:<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">include Java</span><br /><br />Some things to note:<br /><br />    * Capitalization is significant.<br />    * This version generates an error, saying a module name is required but a string has been supplied:<br /><br style="font-weight: bold;" /><span style="font-weight: bold;">      include 'java'</span><br /><br />    * This pre 1.0 form is still out there on some web pages. It doesn't generate any obvious errors, but it doesn't work:<br /><br style="font-weight: bold;" /><span style="font-weight: bold;">      require 'java'</span><br /><br />    * Quotes are an error in this include statement and in the include_class statement. But they're required in the require statement, which comes between them. The mnemonic is "Quotes are required, not included."<br /><br />The program then needed to require every jar file that the program eventually used, even if it wasn't directly referenced in the JRuby script.<br /></blockquote><br />And more:<br /><blockquote><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Accessing External Classes</span><br /><br />So far, so good. But somehow I couldn't find quite enough information on the web to access 3rd party classes. After examining the writeups listed in the Resources and doing a lot of experimenting, I was able to make things work by doing the following:<br /><br />1. Tell JRuby where to find the JAR files. Options:<br /><br />   1. Put them in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">CLASSPATH </span>(did not work for me. JRuby didn't seem to read the environment)<br />   2. Put them in <span style="font-weight: bold;">$RUBY_HOME/lib</span> (haven't tried this)<br />   3. For NetBeans on Windows, in <span style="font-weight: bold;">JRUBY_EXTRA_CLASSPATH</span> (also didn't work for me)<br />   4. Give up and <span style="font-weight: bold;">specify the jar files with a full path</span>, as I did in Step #2.<br />   5. Follow the example Rob Di Marco's example and <span style="font-weight: bold;">put -I</span><directory><span style="font-weight: bold;"> on the command line for every directory that contains a jar file</span>.<br /></directory></blockquote><br />Well, these guys unfortunately are still missing this very important point of making a Ruby implementation that runs on the JVM. The very first thing I would try on any language that compiles to the JVM is the integration with regular class files.<br /><font color="#333399"><br /></font><b><font color="#333399">But don't get me wrong, I do believe JRuby is a hell of a project and the <a href="http://headius.blogspot.com/">blog</a> of the author of it is very very interesting.

event=The new edition (4th) of the proposal for ECMAScript has just being <a href="http://www.ecmascript.org/es4/spec/overview.pdf">finished</a> (on 23 October 2007).<br /><br />Given the tiny fraction of time I spent on it so far, 5 minutes more or less to be precise (I'll read it all soon or later hehe) I could notice a few things that makes me wander, <b>is Javascript loosing its identity to become a mainstream language competing face to face with other dynamic languages like Groovy, Python and Ruby?</b><br /><br />My few highlights:<br />    <ul><li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Classes and Prototypes</span>: I was so far the most popular dynamic Object Oriented language based on prototypes rather than classes and now it will have both mechanisms of defining the operation for your objects;</li>    <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Optional Type inference</span>: now you can if you want statically type your variables, for several reasons they describe even the performance one;</li>    <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Parametric classes</span>: such a polemic addition to the Java platform now finds one more home in the beautiful dynamic Javascript world;</li></ul>And much more very interesting things like <span style="font-style: italic;">visibility control</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">strict mode</span>, <i>et cetera</i>.<br /><br />After a complete read on the new edition of the spec I'll post my thoughts here.<br /><p>Thanks to <a href="http://log4dev.com/">Miguel</a> for pointing me the link to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ecmascript.org/es4/spec/overview.pdf" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)">http://www.ecmascript.org/es4<wbr></wbr>/spec/overview.pdf</a><br /></p>
